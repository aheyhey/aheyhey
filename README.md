- 👋 Hi, I’m Christine
- 👀 I’m interested in the intersection between art and tech, function and aesthetics
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to (1) strengthen my art & design skills and (2) code and build - specifically targeting Front End Dev atm (have fond memories of coding and designing my first websites back in school) but hoping to expand into mobile app dev later on
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects where we create immersive user experiences
- 📫 How to reach me ... cngu5872@gmail.com
